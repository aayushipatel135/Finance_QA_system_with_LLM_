In this case:
Cost of machine = ₹1,90,000
Installation = ₹10,000
Scrap = ₹50,000
Life = 6 years
Depreciation per year = (1,90,000 + 10,000 - 50,000) / 6
Depreciation per year = (1,50,000) / 6
Depreciation per year = ₹25,000

Here's how you can do it:
    Opening balance: 400 units @ Rs 20 each
    Purchase on 3rd October: 300 units @ Rs 10 each
    Sales on 5th October: 500 units
First, you sell the 400 units from the opening balance because they are the earliest to be acquired:
Sales Value for 400 units = 400 units * Rs 20 = Rs 8,000
Then, you sell 100 units out of the 300 units purchased on 3rd October at Rs 10 each:
Sales Value for 100 units = 100 units * Rs 10 = Rs 1,000
The total sales value as per the FIFO method is the sum of these two:
Total Sales Value = Rs 8,000 + Rs 1,000 = Rs 9,000

Here's how you can do it:
    Opening balance: 200 units @ Rs 15 each.Purchase on 4th October: 500 units @ Rs 10 each.Sales on 5th October: 600 units
First, you sell 200 units from the opening balance because they are the earliest to be acquired:
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for 200 units = 200 units * Rs 15 = Rs 3,000
Then, you sell 400 units out of the 500 units purchased on 4th October at Rs 10 each:
COGS for 400 units = 400 units * Rs 10 = Rs 4,000
The remaining 100 units from the purchase on 4th October are your closing inventory. To calculate the closing inventory value:
Closing Inventory Value = 100 units * Rs 10 = Rs 1,000

To find the ratio of expenditure on wheat and paddy, you can calculate it as follows:
    Wheat Price / Paddy Price = 2/3
    Wheat Consumption / Paddy Consumption = 5/4
Let's assume the price of wheat is 2x and the price of paddy is 3x, and the quantities consumed are 5y and 4y, respectively. Now, calculate the expenditure for each item:
Expenditure on Wheat = (Wheat Price) x (Wheat Consumption) = (2x) x (5y) = 10xy
Expenditure on Paddy = (Paddy Price) x (Paddy Consumption) = (3x) x (4y) = 12xy
Now, find the ratio of expenditure on wheat to paddy:
(Expenditure on Wheat) / (Expenditure on Paddy) = (10xy) / (12xy) = 5/6
So, the ratio of expenditure on wheat to paddy is 5:6.

Given: Income ratio of Ramesh and Suresh = 5:6 Spending ratio of Ramesh and Suresh = 7:9 Ramesh saves 4000 Suresh saves 3000
We can set up two equations based on the given information:
    R_income / S_income = 5 / 6 (R_income - R_spending) = 4000 (S_income - S_spending) = 3000
Now, let's solve for R_income and S_income using the income ratio:
From equation 1, we can express R_income in terms of S_income:
R_income = (5/6) * S_income
Now, let's plug this into equations 2 and 3:
    ((5/6) * S_income - R_spending) = 4000 ((6/6) * S_income - S_spending) = 3000
We can simplify these equations as follows:
    (5S_income/6 - R_spending) = 4000 (S_income - S_spending) = 3000
Now, let's solve these equations:
    (5S_income/6 - R_spending) = 4000 5S_income/6 = R_spending + 4000 5S_income = 6(R_spending + 4000) S_income = (6/5)(R_spending + 4000)
    (S_income - S_spending) = 3000 S_income = S_spending + 3000
Now, we have expressions for S_income in terms of R_spending:
S_income = S_spending + 3000 S_income = (6/5)(R_spending + 4000)
We can now set up an equation for R_spending:
R_spending = (5/6)S_income - 4000
To find the values for R_income, R_spending, S_income, and S_spending, you would need additional information or equations. The given information is not sufficient to determine their exact incomes and spendings. Therefore, none of the provided answer choices is correct."

Let's assume the original consumption of cooking oil is 100 units. If the price of cooking oil increases by 25%, the new price becomes 125% of the original price. To keep the expenditure the same, the family should reduce their consumption by the same percentage.
So, the family needs to reduce their consumption to (100/125) * 100 = 80% of the original consumption to maintain the same expenditure.
To find out how much percent the family should reduce their consumption to maintain the same expenditure, you can calculate the difference between the original consumption (100%) and the reduced consumption (80%):
Percentage Reduction = 100% - 80% = 20%
So, the family should reduce the consumption of cooking oil by 20% to maintain the same expenditure.
Answer: (a) 20%"
287,Ramesh’s salary was reduced by 10% and then the reduced salary was increased by 10%. What was his ultimate loss?,a. 0%,b. 10%,c. 1%,d. 5%,c,"Let's assume Ramesh's original salary is 100 units.
Step 1: His salary is reduced by 10%, which means it becomes 90% of the original salary.
Step 2: The reduced salary is increased by 10%, which means it becomes 110% of the reduced salary.
Now, let's calculate the final salary:
Final Salary = (110% of 90% of the original salary)
Final Salary = (110/100) * (90/100) * 100
Final Salary = (99/100) * 100
Final Salary = 99
So, Ramesh's ultimate salary is 99 units.
Now, let's calculate the percentage loss:
Percentage Loss = [(Original Salary - Final Salary) / Original Salary] * 100
Percentage Loss = [(100 - 99) / 100] * 100
Percentage Loss = (1/100) * 100
Percentage Loss = 1%
Ramesh's ultimate loss is 1%.
Answer: (c) 1%"

289,person sold a stove for Rs. 423 and incurred a loss of 6%. At what price would it be sold so as to earn a profit of 8%?,a. rs. 525,b. rs. 500,c. rs. 490,d. rs. 486,d,"Let ""C"" be the cost price of the stove.
Since the person incurred a loss of 6%, the selling price (Rs. 423) is 94% of the cost price (C). This is because:
100% - 6% = 94%
Now, let's calculate the cost price (C):
0.94C = 423
C = 423 / 0.94
C ≈ 450
So, the cost price of the stove is approximately Rs. 450.
To find the selling price needed to earn a profit of 8%, we calculate 108% of the cost price:
108% of Rs. 450 = (108/100) * 450 = Rs. 486
Therefore, the stove should be sold for Rs. 486 to earn a profit of 8%.
Answer: (d) Rs. 486"
290,A fruit seller buys lemons at 2 for a rupee and sells then at 5 for three rupees. His gain percent is,a. 10%,b. 15%,c. 20%,d. 25%,c,"Let's calculate the cost price (C.P.) and selling price (S.P.) of lemons.
Cost Price (C.P.): The seller buys 2 lemons for one rupee, so the cost of one lemon is (1/2) rupee or 50 paise.
Selling Price (S.P.): The seller sells 5 lemons for three rupees, so the selling price of one lemon is (3/5) rupee or 60 paise.
Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = S.P. - C.P.
Profit = (60 paise) - (50 paise)
Profit = 10 paise
To find the gain percent, we use the formula:
Gain Percent = (Profit / C.P.) * 100
Gain Percent = (10 paise / 50 paise) * 100
Gain Percent = (1/5) * 100"
291,"A sells a car to B at 10% loss. If B sells it for Rs. 54000 and gains 20%, the cost price of the car for A was",a. rs. 25000,b. rs. 50000,c. rs. 37500,d. rs. 60000,d,"Let the cost price (C.P.) of the car for A be X.
A sells the car to B at a 10% loss, which means B buys it for 90% of the cost price:
Selling Price (S.P.) to B = 90% of X = 0.9X
B sells the car for Rs. 54,000 and gains 20%, which means the selling price by B is 120% of the cost price:
S.P. by B = 120% of X = 1.2X
Given that S.P. by B is Rs. 54,000, we can equate the two expressions for S.P. to find the value of X:
0.9X = 1.2X = Rs. 54,000
Now, let's solve for X:
0.3X = Rs. 54,000
X = Rs. 54,000 / 0.3
X = Rs. 180,000
So, the cost price of the car for A was Rs. 180,000.
Answer: (d) Rs. 60,000"
292,"Ramesh sold a statue for a price 25% higher than the original price of the statue. He had however bought the statue at 20% discount on the original price. With the profit of Rs. 2025, find the original price of the statue.",a. rs. 6000,b. rs. 7500,c. rs. 3500,d. rs. 4500,b,"Let the original price of the statue be Rs. X.
Ramesh bought the statue at a 20% discount, which means he paid 80% of the original price:
Cost Price (C.P.) = 80% of X = 0.8X
Ramesh sold the statue for a price 25% higher than the original price, which means he sold it for 125% of the original price:
Selling Price (S.P.) = 125% of X = 1.25X
Given that Ramesh made a profit of Rs. 2,025, we can set up the equation:
Profit = S.P. - C.P.
Profit = (1.25X - 0.8X)
Profit = 0.45X
We know that Profit = Rs. 2,025, so:
0.45X = 2,025
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 2,025 / 0.45
X = Rs. 4,500
The original price of the statue was Rs. 4,500.

293,"If selling price of 40 articles is equal to cost price of 50 articles, the loss or gain percent is",a. 25% loss,b. 20% loss,c. 25% gain,d. 20% gain,a,"To calculate the loss or gain percent, we need to compare the selling price and the cost price.
Let the cost price of each article be ""C"" and the selling price of each article be ""S.""
Given that selling price of 40 articles is equal to the cost price of 50 articles, we can write it as:
40S = 50C
Now, let's calculate the ratio of selling price (40S) to cost price (50C):
(40S) / (50C) = (4S) / (5C)
This ratio represents the loss or gain percent. If (4S) / (5C) is less than 1, it's a loss; if it's greater than 1, it's a gain.
So, the loss or gain percent is (4S) / (5C).

Total C.P. = 2 X
Gain or loss % = (Total S.P. - Total C.P.)/Total C.P. * 100

296,"If a person sells a ‘sari’ for Rs. 5200, making a profit of 30%, then the cost price of the sari is",a. rs. 4420,b. rs. 4000,c. rs. 3900,d. rs. 3800,b,"To find the cost price (CP), you need to understand that the selling price (SP) is equal to the CP plus the profit. The formula for this relationship is:
SP = CP + Profit
Given that SP = Rs. 5200 and the profit is 30% of the CP, you can calculate the CP as follows:
CP = SP / (1 + Profit Percentage)
CP = 5200 / (1 + 30/100)
CP = 5200 / 1.30
CP = Rs. 4000"
297,A shopkeeper earns a profit of 15% after selling a book at 20% discount on the printed price. The ratio of the cost price and printed price of the book is?,a. 20:23,b. 23:20,c. 16:23,d. 23:16,c,"Let the printed price of the book be PP, and the cost price be CP. According to the given information, the shopkeeper sells the book at a 20% discount, which means the selling price (SP) is 80% of the printed price (PP). The profit is 15%, so the selling price is 115% of the cost price (CP). Therefore, we have:
SP = 0.8 * PP
SP = 1.15 * CP
You can set up a proportion to find the ratio of CP to PP:
CP / PP = (1.15 * CP) / (0.8 * PP)
CP / PP = (1.15 / 0.8)
CP / PP = 1.4375
To get this in the form of a ratio, you can express 1.4375 as 16/23, which means the ratio of CP to PP is 16:23."

To nullify this loss, she needs to make a profit of 40% on the remaining 2/3 of the supplies. To find the profit percentage needed to nullify the loss, you can calculate it as follows:
Required Profit Percentage = (Loss Percentage / Lossed Portion) * Remaining Portion
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)

299,Ramesh gets a profit of 20% in one trade and suffers a loss of 20% in the second when he sells 2 cycles for Rs. 4000 each. What is his profit or loss in the entire trade?,a. loss = 4%,b. loss = 16%,c. profit = 16%,d. profit = 4%,a,"Ramesh sells 2 cycles for Rs. 4000 each in two trades. In the first trade, he makes a profit of 20%, so the selling price for the first cycle is 120% of its cost price. In the second trade, he incurs a loss of 20%, so the selling price for the second cycle is 80% of its cost price.
To find the overall profit or loss, you can calculate it as follows:
Total Selling Price = Selling Price of 1st Cycle + Selling Price of 2nd Cycle
Total Selling Price = (120% of Cost Price) + (80% of Cost Price)
Total Selling Price = (120/100) * Cost Price + (80/100) * Cost Price
Total Selling Price = (200/100) * Cost Price
Total Selling Price = 2 * Cost Price
Now, Ramesh sells two cycles for Rs. 4000 each, so the total selling price is Rs. 4000 + Rs. 4000 = Rs. 8000.
To calculate the profit or loss percentage:
Profit or Loss Percentage = [(Total Selling Price - Total Cost Price) / Total Cost Price] * 100%
Profit or Loss Percentage = [(Rs. 8000 - Rs. 8000) / Rs. 8000] * 100%
Profit or Loss Percentage = [(0 / Rs. 8000) * 100%] = 0%
Ramesh neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss; his overall profit or loss is 0%, which means no profit or loss."

For the investment in SBI:
Principal (P) = Rs. 500
Time (T) = 2 years
Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 220
Rate of Interest (R1) = (SI * 100) / (P * T) = (220 * 100) / (500 * 2) = 44000 / 1000 = 44%
For the investment in ICICI:
Principal (P) = Rs. 300
Time (T) = 4 years
Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 220
Rate of Interest (R2) = (SI * 100) / (P * T) = (220 * 100) / (300 * 4) = 22000 / 1200 = 11/6 = 5.5%
The overall rate of interest is the combined rate of interest for both investments. So, R = (R1 + R2) / 2 = (44% + 5.5%) / 2 = 49.5% / 2 = 24.75% ≈ 25%.

For the next three years at 9%:
Principal2 (P2) = (SI2 * 100) / (R2 * T2) = (SI2 * 100) / (9 * 3) = (SI2 * 100) / 27 = (SI2 * 100/27)
For the remaining four years at 14%:
Principal3 (P3) = (SI3 * 100) / (R3 * T3) = (SI3 * 100) / (14 * 4) = (SI3 * 25/7)

SI1 + SI2 + SI3 = 11400
(P1 * 50) + (P2 * 100/27) + (P3 * 25/7) = 11400
To solve this equation, we need to find the values of P1, P2, and P3. Adding these values will give us the total principal amount borrowed (P).

For the second case at 15% per annum:
SI2 = (P * 15 * T) / 100
P2 = P + SI2 = P + (P * 15 * T) / 100 = P * (1 + 15T/100)
Given that P1 = Rs. 3000 and P2 = Rs. 3300 and the time (T) is the same for both cases.

Time (T) = 9 months = 9/12 years (since 1 year = 12 months)
Plug in these values into the formula:
SI = (78000 * 15.4 * 9/12) / 100

To make the interest a whole number, the denominator in the rate should divide 100 evenly. So, the possible denominators are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.
Among these, 3 (from 2/3) and 25 (from 25/100) do not divide 100 evenly. All the others do.

Interest (SI) = Rs. 81
Rate (R) = 4.5% per annum
We need to find T. Rearrange the formula to solve for T:

T = (81 * 100) / (900 * 4.5)
