Option A : A.Rs 9000 Option B : B.Rs 15000 Option C : C.Rs 10000 Option D : D.Rs 7500 Correct Ans :  a Explanation : To calculate the total sales value using the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) method, you need to match the cost of the units sold with the earliest purchases first. Here's how you can do it:
    Opening balance: 400 units @ Rs 20 each
    Purchase on 3rd October: 300 units @ Rs 10 each
    Sales on 5th October: 500 units
First, you sell the 400 units from the opening balance because they are the earliest to be acquired:
Sales Value for 400 units = 400 units * Rs 20 = Rs 8,000
Then, you sell 100 units out of the 300 units purchased on 3rd October at Rs 10 each:
Sales Value for 100 units = 100 units * Rs 10 = Rs 1,000

Here's how you can do it:
    Opening balance: 200 units @ Rs 15 each.Purchase on 4th October: 500 units @ Rs 10 each.Sales on 5th October: 600 units
First, you sell 200 units from the opening balance because they are the earliest to be acquired:
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for 200 units = 200 units * Rs 15 = Rs 3,000
Then, you sell 400 units out of the 500 units purchased on 4th October at Rs 10 each:
COGS for 400 units = 400 units * Rs 10 = Rs 4,000
The remaining 100 units from the purchase on 4th October are your closing inventory. To calculate the closing inventory value:

Find the ratio of expenditure of wheat and paddy. Option A : a. 6:5 Option B : b. 5:6 Option C : c. 1:1 Option D : d. 8:15 Correct Ans :  b Explanation :  The ratio of market prices of wheat and paddy is 2:3, and the ratio of quantities consumed in a family is 5:4. To find the ratio of expenditure on wheat and paddy, you can calculate it as follows:
    Wheat Price / Paddy Price = 2/3
    Wheat Consumption / Paddy Consumption = 5/4
Let's assume the price of wheat is 2x and the price of paddy is 3x, and the quantities consumed are 5y and 4y, respectively. Now, calculate the expenditure for each item:
Expenditure on Wheat = (Wheat Price) x (Wheat Consumption) = (2x) x (5y) = 10xy
Expenditure on Paddy = (Paddy Price) x (Paddy Consumption) = (3x) x (4y) = 12xy
Now, find the ratio of expenditure on wheat to paddy:
(Expenditure on Wheat) / (Expenditure on Paddy) = (10xy) / (12xy) = 5/6
So, the ratio of expenditure on wheat to paddy is 5:6.

261,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : The three numbers are in the ratio 1/2 : 2/3 : 3/4. The difference between greatest and smallest numbers is 36. Find the numbers Option A : a.72, 84, 108 Option B : b. 60, 72, 96 Option C : c.72, 84, 96 Option D : d.72, 96, 108 Correct Ans :  a Explanation : The three numbers are in the ratio 1/2:2/3:3/4. Let the common ratio be ""x."" Then, the numbers are 1/2x, 2/3x, and 3/4x. The difference between the greatest and smallest numbers is 36, so:
3/4x - 1/2x = 36
(3/4 - 1/2)x = 36
(1/4)x = 36
x = 36 * 4 = 144
Now, find the numbers:
First number = (1/2) * 144 = 72
Second number = (2/3) * 144 = 96
Third number = (3/4) * 144 = 108

So, the numbers are 72, 96, and 108.

    First, find a common factor between the ratios a:b and c:d. In this case, the common factor is 2. So, multiply both sides of the first ratio by 2.
    Now, you have a:b = 10:14 and c:d = 2a:3b = 2(10):3(14) = 20:42.
To find ac:bd, simply multiply the corresponding terms:
ac:bd = (10 * 20):(14 * 42) = 200:588 = 100:294 = 50:147

    First, find the values of 7x and 7y based on the given ratio:
    7x = 7 * 3x = 21x
    7y = 7 * 4y = 28y
    Now, calculate (7x+3y)/(7x-3y):
    (21x + 3y)/(21x - 3y) = 3(7x + y)/3(7x - y) = (3(7x + y))/(3(7x - y)) = (7x + y)/(7x - y)
So, (7x+3y)/(7x-3y) is equal to (7x + y)/(7x - y).

Income and spending respectively of Ramesh and Suresh are Option A : a. ramesh - 25000, 21000; suresh - 30000, 27000 Option B : b. ramesh - 36000, 32000; suresh - 30000, 27000 Option C : c. ramesh - 30000, 27000; suresh - 36000, 32000 Option D : d. none of the above Correct Ans :  a Explanation : Let's denote Ramesh's income and spending as R_income and R_spending, and Suresh's income and spending as S_income and S_spending.
Given: Income ratio of Ramesh and Suresh = 5:6 Spending ratio of Ramesh and Suresh = 7:9 Ramesh saves 4000 Suresh saves 3000
We can set up two equations based on the given information:
    R_income / S_income = 5 / 6 (R_income - R_spending) = 4000 (S_income - S_spending) = 3000
Now, let's solve for R_income and S_income using the income ratio:
From equation 1, we can express R_income in terms of S_income:
R_income = (5/6) * S_income
Now, let's plug this into equations 2 and 3:
    ((5/6) * S_income - R_spending) = 4000 ((6/6) * S_income - S_spending) = 3000
We can simplify these equations as follows:
    (5S_income/6 - R_spending) = 4000 (S_income - S_spending) = 3000
Now, let's solve these equations:
    (5S_income/6 - R_spending) = 4000 5S_income/6 = R_spending + 4000 5S_income = 6(R_spending + 4000) S_income = (6/5)(R_spending + 4000)
    (S_income - S_spending) = 3000 S_income = S_spending + 3000
Now, we have expressions for S_income in terms of R_spending:
S_income = S_spending + 3000 S_income = (6/5)(R_spending + 4000)
We can now set up an equation for R_spending:
R_spending = (5/6)S_income - 4000
To find the values for R_income, R_spending, S_income, and S_spending, you would need additional information or equations. The given information is not sufficient to determine their exact incomes and spendings. Therefore, none of the provided answer choices is correct."

What is the ratio of the amount with A to that with M earlier? Option A : a. 7 : 4 Option B : b. 5 : 3 Option C : c. 2 : 1 Option D : d. 7 : 6 Correct Ans :  d Explanation : Let the initial amount with A be A1, and the initial amount with M be M1.
Given that by giving Rs. 50 to M, A would have the amount equal to what M had earlier, we can write this as:
A1 - 50 = M1
The sum of the amounts with A and M is Rs. 650:
A1 + M1 = 650
Now, we have a system of two equations:
A1 - 50 = M1
A1 + M1 = 650
You can solve these equations to find A1 and M1. Once you have those values, you can calculate the ratio of the amount with A to that with M earlier (A1/M1).
Solving these equations will give you A1 = 350 and M1 = 400.
Now, you can find the ratio of A1 to M1:
(A1/M1) = (350/400) = 7/8
So, the ratio of the amount with A to that with M earlier is 7:8.

Option A : a. 20% Option B : b. 25% Option C : c. 18% Option D : d. 16% Correct Ans :  a Explanation :     The price of cooking oil has increased by 25%. By what percent should a family reduce the consumption of cooking oil so as not to increase the expenditure in this account?
Let's assume the original consumption of cooking oil is 100 units. If the price of cooking oil increases by 25%, the new price becomes 125% of the original price. To keep the expenditure the same, the family should reduce their consumption by the same percentage.
So, the family needs to reduce their consumption to (100/125) * 100 = 80% of the original consumption to maintain the same expenditure.
To find out how much percent the family should reduce their consumption to maintain the same expenditure, you can calculate the difference between the original consumption (100%) and the reduced consumption (80%):
Percentage Reduction = 100% - 80% = 20%
So, the family should reduce the consumption of cooking oil by 20% to maintain the same expenditure.

Option A : a. 0% Option B : b. 10% Option C : c. 1% Option D : d. 5% Correct Ans :  c Explanation : Let's assume Ramesh's original salary is 100 units.
Step 1: His salary is reduced by 10%, which means it becomes 90% of the original salary.
Step 2: The reduced salary is increased by 10%, which means it becomes 110% of the reduced salary.
Now, let's calculate the final salary:
Final Salary = (110% of 90% of the original salary)
Final Salary = (110/100) * (90/100) * 100
Final Salary = (99/100) * 100
Final Salary = 99
So, Ramesh's ultimate salary is 99 units.
Now, let's calculate the percentage loss:
Percentage Loss = [(Original Salary - Final Salary) / Original Salary] * 100

Option A : a. rs. 525 Option B : b. rs. 500 Option C : c. rs. 490 Option D : d. rs. 486 Correct Ans :  d Explanation : Let ""C"" be the cost price of the stove.
Since the person incurred a loss of 6%, the selling price (Rs. 423) is 94% of the cost price (C). This is because:
100% - 6% = 94%
Now, let's calculate the cost price (C):
0.94C = 423
C = 423 / 0.94
C ≈ 450
So, the cost price of the stove is approximately Rs. 450.
To find the selling price needed to earn a profit of 8%, we calculate 108% of the cost price:
108% of Rs. 450 = (108/100) * 450 = Rs. 486

His gain percent is Option A : a. 10% Option B : b. 15% Option C : c. 20% Option D : d. 25% Correct Ans :  c Explanation : Let's calculate the cost price (C.P.) and selling price (S.P.) of lemons.
Cost Price (C.P.): The seller buys 2 lemons for one rupee, so the cost of one lemon is (1/2) rupee or 50 paise.
Selling Price (S.P.): The seller sells 5 lemons for three rupees, so the selling price of one lemon is (3/5) rupee or 60 paise.
Now, let's calculate the profit:
Profit = S.P. - C.P.
Profit = (60 paise) - (50 paise)
Profit = 10 paise
To find the gain percent, we use the formula:
Gain Percent = (Profit / C.P.) * 100
Gain Percent = (10 paise / 50 paise) * 100
Gain Percent = (1/5) * 100"

A sells the car to B at a 10% loss, which means B buys it for 90% of the cost price:
Selling Price (S.P.) to B = 90% of X = 0.9X
B sells the car for Rs. 54,000 and gains 20%, which means the selling price by B is 120% of the cost price:
S.P. by B = 120% of X = 1.2X
Given that S.P. by B is Rs. 54,000, we can equate the two expressions for S.P. to find the value of X:
0.9X = 1.2X = Rs. 54,000
Now, let's solve for X:
0.3X = Rs. 54,000
X = Rs. 54,000 / 0.3
X = Rs. 180,000

Option A : a. rs. 6000 Option B : b. rs. 7500 Option C : c. rs. 3500 Option D : d. rs. 4500 Correct Ans :  b Explanation : Let the original price of the statue be Rs. X.
Ramesh bought the statue at a 20% discount, which means he paid 80% of the original price:
Cost Price (C.P.) = 80% of X = 0.8X
Ramesh sold the statue for a price 25% higher than the original price, which means he sold it for 125% of the original price:
Selling Price (S.P.) = 125% of X = 1.25X
Given that Ramesh made a profit of Rs. 2,025, we can set up the equation:
Profit = S.P. - C.P.
Profit = (1.25X - 0.8X)
Profit = 0.45X
We know that Profit = Rs. 2,025, so:
0.45X = 2,025
Now, let's solve for X:
X = 2,025 / 0.45
X = Rs. 4,500
The original price of the statue was Rs. 4,500.

(40S) / (50C) = (4S) / (5C)
This ratio represents the loss or gain percent. If (4S) / (5C) is less than 1, it's a loss; if it's greater than 1, it's a gain.
So, the loss or gain percent is (4S) / (5C).

293,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Two bicycles were sold for Rs. 3990 each, gaining 5% on one and losing 5% on the other. The gain or loss percent on the whole transaction is Option A : a. neither gain nor loss Option B : b. 2.5% gain Option C : c. 2.5% loss Option D : d. 0.25% loss Correct Ans :  d Explanation : Let C.P. of each bicycle be Rs. X.
S.P. of one bicycle = 1.05 X
S.P. of another bicycle = 0.95 X
Total S.P. = 1.05 X + 0.95 X = 2 X
Total C.P. = 2 X
Gain or loss % = (Total S.P. - Total C.P.)/Total C.P. * 100
= (2 X - 2 X)/2 X * 100 = 0%. The answer is 0%."
294,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : The ratio of cost price and selling price is 4:5. The profit percent is Option A : a. 10% Option B : b. 20% Option C : c. 25% Option D : d. 30% Correct Ans :  c Explanation : Let the cost price (C.P.) be 4 units, and the selling price (S.P.) be 5 units.
Profit = S.P. - C.P. = 5 - 4 = 1 unit
To find the profit percent, divide the profit by the cost price and multiply by 100:
Profit Percent = (Profit / C.P.) * 100
Profit Percent = (1 / 4) * 100
Profit Percent = 25%

295,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : If a person sells a ‘sari’ for Rs. 5200, making a profit of 30%, then the cost price of the sari is Option A : a. rs. 4420 Option B : b. rs. 4000 Option C : c. rs. 3900 Option D : d. rs. 3800 Correct Ans :  b Explanation : To find the cost price (CP), you need to understand that the selling price (SP) is equal to the CP plus the profit. The formula for this relationship is:
SP = CP + Profit
Given that SP = Rs. 5200 and the profit is 30% of the CP, you can calculate the CP as follows:
CP = SP / (1 + Profit Percentage)
CP = 5200 / (1 + 30/100)
CP = 5200 / 1.30
CP = Rs. 4000"

The ratio of the cost price and printed price of the book is? Option A : a. 20:23 Option B : b. 23:20 Option C : c. 16:23 Option D : d. 23:16 Correct Ans :  c Explanation : Let the printed price of the book be PP, and the cost price be CP. According to the given information, the shopkeeper sells the book at a 20% discount, which means the selling price (SP) is 80% of the printed price (PP). The profit is 15%, so the selling price is 115% of the cost price (CP). Therefore, we have:
SP = 0.8 * PP
SP = 1.15 * CP
You can set up a proportion to find the ratio of CP to PP:
CP / PP = (1.15 * CP) / (0.8 * PP)
CP / PP = (1.15 / 0.8)
CP / PP = 1.4375
To get this in the form of a ratio, you can express 1.4375 as 16/23, which means the ratio of CP to PP is 16:23."

What profit she must earn on rest of the supplies to nullify this loss? Option A : a. 25% Option B : b. 20% Option C : c. 45% Option D : d. 50% Correct Ans :  b Explanation : Simran incurred a 40% loss on 1/3 of the supplies. To nullify this loss, she needs to make a profit of 40% on the remaining 2/3 of the supplies. To find the profit percentage needed to nullify the loss, you can calculate it as follows:
Required Profit Percentage = (Loss Percentage / Lossed Portion) * Remaining Portion
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)
Required Profit Percentage = (40% / (1/3)) * (2/3)

298,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Ramesh gets a profit of 20% in one trade and suffers a loss of 20% in the second when he sells 2 cycles for Rs. 4000 each. What is his profit or loss in the entire trade? Option A : a. loss = 4% Option B : b. loss = 16% Option C : c. profit = 16% Option D : d. profit = 4% Correct Ans :  a Explanation : Ramesh sells 2 cycles for Rs. 4000 each in two trades. In the first trade, he makes a profit of 20%, so the selling price for the first cycle is 120% of its cost price. In the second trade, he incurs a loss of 20%, so the selling price for the second cycle is 80% of its cost price.
To find the overall profit or loss, you can calculate it as follows:
Total Selling Price = Selling Price of 1st Cycle + Selling Price of 2nd Cycle
Total Selling Price = (120% of Cost Price) + (80% of Cost Price)
Total Selling Price = (120/100) * Cost Price + (80/100) * Cost Price
Total Selling Price = (200/100) * Cost Price
Total Selling Price = 2 * Cost Price
Now, Ramesh sells two cycles for Rs. 4000 each, so the total selling price is Rs. 4000 + Rs. 4000 = Rs. 8000.
To calculate the profit or loss percentage:
Profit or Loss Percentage = [(Total Selling Price - Total Cost Price) / Total Cost Price] * 100%
Profit or Loss Percentage = [(Rs. 8000 - Rs. 8000) / Rs. 8000] * 100%
Profit or Loss Percentage = [(0 / Rs. 8000) * 100%] = 0%
Ramesh neither makes a profit nor incurs a loss; his overall profit or loss is 0%, which means no profit or loss."

Find the quantity of sugar sold at 25% profit? Option A : a. 120 kg Option B : b. 96.5 kg Option C : c. 84 kg Option D : d. 67 kg Correct Ans :  d Explanation : The trader has 200 kg of sugar and gains 15% on the whole. Let ""x"" be the quantity of sugar sold at 10% profit and ""y"" be the quantity sold at 25% profit. The total profit equation is:
0.10x + 0.25y = 0.15(200)
Simplifying the equation, you get:

10x + 25y = 6000
Divide the equation by 5 to make it simpler:
2x + 5y = 1200
Now, find values of x and y where x + y = 200 (total quantity of sugar). By solving these two equations:
2x + 5y = 1200
x + y = 200
You'll find x = 80 kg and y = 120 kg. So, the quantity of sugar sold at a 25% profit is 120 kg."

Option A : a. rs. 8400 Option B : b. rs. 10,500 Option C : c. rs. 13,600 Option D : d. rs. 14,700 Correct Ans :  b Explanation : To find P's share of the profit, you need to determine the individual contributions of P, Q, and R to the total capital.
Let R's capital be x. Then Q's capital is (x + Rs. 5,000), and P's capital is (x + Rs. 5,000 + Rs. 4,000).
The total capital is the sum of their individual capitals, which is Rs. 50,000.
So, (x) + (x + Rs. 5,000) + (x + Rs. 5,000 + Rs. 4,000) = Rs. 50,000
Solving for x, you'll find that x = Rs. 10,000.
Now, you can calculate P's capital (P's share) and find P's share of the total profit:
P's capital = Rs. 10,000 + Rs. 5,000 + Rs. 4,000 = Rs. 19,000

323,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Eleven bags are bought for Rs.1000 and sold at 10 for Rs.1100. What is the gain or loss in percentage? Option A : a. 10% Option B : b. 21% Option C : c. 25% Option D : d. 20% Correct Ans :  b Explanation : Eleven bags are bought for Rs. 1000 and sold at 10 for Rs. 1100. To calculate the gain or loss percentage:
Cost Price of 11 bags = Rs. 1000
Cost Price of 10 bags = (10/11) * Rs. 1000 = Rs. 909.09 (approximately)
Selling Price of 10 bags = Rs. 1100
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = Rs. 1100 - Rs. 909.09 ≈ Rs. 190.91
Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100% = (Rs. 190.91 / Rs. 909.09) * 100% ≈ 21%
So, there is a 21% gain."
324,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Vijay sells a cupboard at 14% below cost price. Had he got
Rs.2086 more, he would have made a profit of 14%. What is the cost price of the cupboard? Option A : a. 7450 Option B : b. 14900 Option C : c. 7400 Option D : d.7500 Correct Ans :  a Explanation : Vijay sells a cupboard at 14% below the cost price. Had he got Rs. 2086 more, he would have made a profit of 14%.
Let the cost price of the cupboard be ""X"" rupees.
Selling Price (with 14% profit) = Cost Price + 14% of Cost Price
Selling Price = X + 0.14X = 1.14X
Vijay sells the cupboard at 14% below the cost price, so:
Selling Price (with 14% loss) = X - 0.14X = 0.86X
Now, we are given that if he had received Rs. 2086 more, he would have made a 14% profit:
1.14X = 0.86X + Rs. 2086
Solving for X:
0.28X = Rs. 2086
X = Rs. 2086 / 0.28 ≈ Rs. 7450"

We need to find the Principal amount (P).
Rearrange the formula to solve for Principal (P):
P = (SI * 100) / (R * T)
P = (9600 * 100) / (16 * 5) = 960000 / 80 = Rs. 12000
So, Kabir took a loan of Rs. 12000, which corresponds to option b."
328,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Suresh for 2 years invested Rs. 500 in SBI. He also invested Rs. 300 in ICICI for 4 years. At the end he received Rs. 220 from both banks as simple interest. What must have been rate of interest? Option A : a. 10% Option B : b. 12% Option C : c. 11% Option D : d. 5.5% Correct Ans :  a Explanation :  Let's calculate the rate of interest for each investment separately.
For the investment in SBI:
Principal (P) = Rs. 500
Time (T) = 2 years
Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 220
Rate of Interest (R1) = (SI * 100) / (P * T) = (220 * 100) / (500 * 2) = 44000 / 1000 = 44%
For the investment in ICICI:
Principal (P) = Rs. 300
Time (T) = 4 years
Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 220
Rate of Interest (R2) = (SI * 100) / (P * T) = (220 * 100) / (300 * 4) = 22000 / 1200 = 11/6 = 5.5%
The overall rate of interest is the combined rate of interest for both investments. So, R = (R1 + R2) / 2 = (44% + 5.5%) / 2 = 49.5% / 2 = 24.75% ≈ 25%.
The rate of interest is approximately 25%, which corresponds to option a."
329,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Raman paid Rs. 11400 as interest after 9 years. He had borrowed some money at rate of 6% for first two years, 9% for next three years and 14% for rest of the period. How much money did he borrow? Option A : a. rs. 10000 Option B : b. rs. 15000 Option C : c. rs. 12000 Option D : d. rs. 12500 Correct Ans :  c Explanation : Let's calculate the principal amount borrowed for each period of time.
For the first two years at 6%:
Principal1 (P1) = (SI1 * 100) / (R1 * T1) = (SI1 * 100) / (6 * 2) = (SI1 * 50)
For the next three years at 9%:
Principal2 (P2) = (SI2 * 100) / (R2 * T2) = (SI2 * 100) / (9 * 3) = (SI2 * 100) / 27 = (SI2 * 100/27)
For the remaining four years at 14%:
Principal3 (P3) = (SI3 * 100) / (R3 * T3) = (SI3 * 100) / (14 * 4) = (SI3 * 25/7)
Given that the total interest paid is Rs. 11400, we have:
SI1 + SI2 + SI3 = 11400
(P1 * 50) + (P2 * 100/27) + (P3 * 25/7) = 11400
To solve this equation, we need to find the values of P1, P2, and P3. Adding these values will give us the total principal amount borrowed (P).
The only option that allows for a combination of P1, P2, and P3 to sum up to 11400 is option c (Rs. 12000).
So, Raman borrowed Rs. 12000, which corresponds to option c."
330,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Ram gets Rs. 2600 for Rs. 2000 in 5 years at some rate of simple interest. Had he invested in other places where rate of simple interest is 3% more than current rate, how much would have Ram got in same time? Option A : a. rs. 2900 Option B : b. rs. 3000 Option C : c. rs. 3100 Option D : d. rs. 2800 Correct Ans :  a Explanation : Let's denote the current rate as ""R.""
Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
For the initial investment:
SI1 = (2000 * R * 5) / 100 = 100R
If he invested at a rate 3% more, the new rate would be (R + 3).
For the new investment:
SI2 = (2000 * (R + 3) * 5) / 100 = 100(R + 3)
Ram would have received the difference in interest between the two investments:
Difference in Interest = SI2 - SI1 = 100(R + 3) - 100R = 300
So, Ram would have received an additional Rs. 300 in the same time. Therefore, the total amount he would have received is Rs. 2600 (initial) + Rs. 300 (additional) = Rs. 2900, which corresponds to option a."

333,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Aman invests Rs. 8000 at some rate of interest. Being simple interest the money doubles in 5 years. Raj sees this and invests Rs. 6250 for 3 years at same rate of interest. How much interest does Raj get? Option A : a. rs. 3750 Option B : b. rs. 6250 Option C : c. rs. 3125 Option D : d. rs. 4250 Correct Ans :  a Explanation : Aman's money doubles in 5 years, which means he earns a simple interest equal to the principal amount. So, the interest he earns is Rs. 8000.
Raj invests Rs. 6250 at the same rate of interest for 3 years. To find the interest earned by Raj, we can use the simple interest formula:
SI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
SI (Raj) = (6250 * Rate * 3) / 100
Since we know that Aman's money doubled in 5 years (which is the same as earning an interest equal to the principal), we can calculate the rate of interest (R) using the formula:
8000 = (8000 * R * 5) / 100
Solving for R, we get R = 100/5 = 20%.
Now, calculate the interest earned by Raj:
SI (Raj) = (6250 * 20 * 3) / 100 = Rs. 3750
So, Raj gets an interest of Rs. 3750, which corresponds to option a."

Option A : a. 10% Option B : b. 15% Option C : c. 30% Option D : d. 5% Correct Ans :  b Explanation : Let the principal amount be ""P"" and the rate of interest be ""R.""
For simple interest (SI) for 2 years:
SI = (P * R * 2) / 100 = (2PR) / 100
Given: SI = Rs. 600
(2PR) / 100 = 600
PR = (600 * 100) / 2 = 30000
For compound interest (CI) for 2 years:
CI = P * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]
Given: CI = Rs. 645
P * [(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] = 645
Solve this equation. After solving, you will find that R ≈ 15%.
So, the rate of interest is approximately 15%, which corresponds to option b."
335,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : In 4 years the simple interest on certain sum of money is 9/25 of the principal. The annual rate of interest is Option A : a. 4% Option B : b. 4(1/2)% Option C : c. 9% Option D : d. 10% Correct Ans :  c Explanation : Let P be the principal amount and R be the rate of interest.
Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100
Given that in 4 years, the SI is 9/25 of the principal, we have:
(P * R * 4) / 100 = (9/25) * P
Canceling P on both sides:
4R = (9/25) * 100
4R = 36
R = 36/4
R = 9
So, the annual rate of interest is 9%, which corresponds to option c."
336,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : A sum becomes Rs. 3000 at the rate of 12% per annum (simple interest). The same sum becomes Rs. 3300 at the rate of 15% per annum (simple interest) in the same duration. Find the sum and the duration. Option A : a. rs. 2000 and 20 years Option B : b. rs. 1900 and 8.25 years Option C : c. rs. 1500 and 7 years Option D : d. rs. 1800 and 5.5 years Correct Ans :  d Explanation : Let the principal amount be P, and let the time be T years.
For the first case at 12% per annum:
SI1 = (P * 12 * T) / 100
P1 = P + SI1 = P + (P * 12 * T) / 100 = P * (1 + 12T/100)
For the second case at 15% per annum:
SI2 = (P * 15 * T) / 100
P2 = P + SI2 = P + (P * 15 * T) / 100 = P * (1 + 15T/100)
Given that P1 = Rs. 3000 and P2 = Rs. 3300 and the time (T) is the same for both cases.
From P1, we have:
P * (1 + 12T/100) = 3000
From P2, we have:
P * (1 + 15T/100) = 3300
Divide the second equation by the first equation:
(1 + 15T/100) / (1 + 12T/100) = 3300 / 3000
Simplify and solve for T:
(1 + 15T/100) / (1 + 12T/100) = 11/10
Cross-multiply : 
10(1 + 15T/100) = 11(1 + 12T/100)
10 + 15T/10 = 11 + 12T/10
15T/10 - 12T/10 = 11 - 10
3T/10 = 1
3T = 10
T = 10/3 = 3.33 years (approximately)
Now, calculate the principal amount P using P1:
P1 = P * (1 + 12T/100) = 3000
P * (1 + 12 * 3.33/100) = 3000
P * (1 + 0.04) = 3000
P * 1.04 = 3000
P = 3000 / 1.04 ≈ 2884.62 (approximately)
So, the sum is approximately Rs. 2884.62, and the duration is approximately 3.33 years. None of the provided options match exactly, but the closest option is d."
337,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : An amount becomes 7 times in 15 years. In how many years will the same amount become 10 times? The rate of interest remains the same for both cases. Option A : a. 20 years Option B : b. 18.75 years Option C : c. 22.50 years Option D : d. 21.50 years Correct Ans :  c Explanation : Since the rate of interest remains the same, the time required for the amount to become ""x"" times is inversely proportional to ""x.""

Time1 / Time2 = x2 / x1
Given that the amount becomes 7 times in 15 years, we have:
Time1 / Time2 = 10 / 7
Time1 = (10 / 7) * Time2
Time1 = (10 / 7) * 15 = 150 / 7 ≈ 21.43 years
So, the same amount will become 10 times in approximately 21.43 years, which is closest to option c (22.50 years)."
338,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : In 40 years an amount becomes 6 times the original amount.

In 40 years, the amount becomes 6 times the original amount, so we have:
P + (P * R * 40) / 100 = 6P
Simplify the equation:
(P * R * 40) / 100 = 5P
Cancel P on both sides:
R * 40 / 100 = 5
R = (5 * 100) / 40 = 500 / 40 = 12.5%
So, the rate of interest is 12.5%, which corresponds to option a."
339,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : A TV can be bought for Rs. 20000 cash or by paying in four equal monthly installments with an initial down payment of Rs. 4000. If the rate of interest for this facility is 8% per annum, then what would be the installment charged for each month? Option A : a. rs. 4000 Option B : b. rs. 4106.67 Option C : c. rs. 4050.33 Option D : d. rs. 4066.01 Correct Ans :  d Explanation : The cash price of the TV is Rs. 20000, and the installment plan requires an initial down payment of Rs. 4000. This means that the remaining amount to be paid in installments is Rs. 20000 - Rs. 4000 = Rs. 16000.
The installment plan involves four equal monthly installments, so the total number of months for payment is 4.
Let ""P"" be the monthly installment amount, and ""r"" be the monthly interest rate (8% per annum is equivalent to 8/12 percent per month).
You can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to find the monthly installment amount:
P = (A * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))
Where:
A = Amount to be paid (Rs. 16000)
r = Monthly interest rate (8% per annum is 8/12 percent per month)
n = Number of installments (4 months)
P = (16000 * (8/12) / (1 - (1 + 8/12)^(-4))
P ≈ (13333.33 / (1 - 0.49382716))
P ≈ (13333.33 / 0.50617284)
P ≈ Rs. 26322"

The total interest received was Rs.297. How much amount was originally given? Option A : a. 4500 Option B : b. 5500 Option C : c. 3950 Option D : d. 4200 Correct Ans :  a Explanation :     Interest on 1/5 of X at 3% = (1/5) * X * (3/100)
    Interest on 1/3 of X at 5% = (1/3) * X * (5/100)
    Interest on 2/5 of X at 9% = (2/5) * X * (9/100)
    Interest on 4/15 of X at 11% = (4/15) * X * (11/100)
The total interest received is given as Rs. 297, so we can write the equation:
[(1/5) * X * (3/100)] + [(1/3) * X * (5/100)] + [(2/5) * X * (9/100)] + [(4/15) * X * (11/100)] = 297

350,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Find the simple interest on Rs. 78000 at 15(2/5) % per annum for 9 months. Option A : a. rs. 7804 Option B : b. rs. 8979 Option C : c. rs. 8046 Option D : d. rs. 9009 Correct Ans :  d Explanation : To calculate simple interest, you can use the formula:
Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 78000
Rate (R) = 15(2/5)% = 15.4% (convert the mixed fraction to a decimal)
Time (T) = 9 months = 9/12 years (since 1 year = 12 months)
Plug in these values into the formula:
SI = (78000 * 15.4 * 9/12) / 100
SI = (90090) / 100
SI = Rs. 9009
So, the simple interest is Rs. 9009, which corresponds to option d."
351,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : Simple interest at x% for x years will come out to be Rs x on a sum of Rs? Option A : a. x Option B : b. 100/x Option C : c. 100/x2 Option D : d. 100x Correct Ans :  b Explanation : The question is asking for the principal amount (sum) in terms of x% and x years, such that the simple interest is Rs x.
Using the simple interest formula:
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
Given:
SI = x
R = x%
T = x years
We need to find P. Rearrange the formula to solve for P:
P = (SI * 100) / (R * T)
P = (x * 100) / (x% * x) = (x * 100) / (x/100 * x) = (x * 100) / (x^2/100) = (x * 100 * 100) / x^2 = 10000 / x
So, the principal amount (sum) is 100/x, which corresponds to option b."
352,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : What is the minimum number of years upon which SI on Rs 2600 at 6.67% interest rate will be in whole number? Option A : a. 2 Option B : b. 6 Option C : c. 3 Option D : d. 4  Correct Ans :  c Explanation : To find the minimum number of years for which the simple interest is a whole number, we need to consider the rate of interest.
The rate is 6.67%, which can be written as 200/3% (because 6.67% = 6.67/100 = 200/3/100 = 200/300 = 2/3).
To make the interest a whole number, the denominator in the rate should divide 100 evenly. So, the possible denominators are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.
Among these, 3 (from 2/3) and 25 (from 25/100) do not divide 100 evenly. All the others do.
For the denominator 1, the interest will be a whole number in 1 year.
For the denominator 2, the interest will be a whole number in 2 years.
For the denominator 4, the interest will be a whole number in 4 years.
For the denominator 5, the interest will be a whole number in 5 years.

For the denominator 50, the interest will be a whole number in 50 years.
For the denominator 100, the interest will be a whole number in 100 years.
The minimum number of years is 3 (from the denominator 3), which corresponds to option c."
353,"Answer the following Multiple choice question :  Question : What time will be taken by an amount of Rs. 900 to yield Rs. 81 as interest at 4.5% per annum of simple interest? Option A : a. 2 years Option B : b. 1 years Option C : c. 3 years Option D : d. 4 years Correct Ans :  a Explanation : To find the time (T) it will take for an amount to yield a certain interest, you can use the simple interest formula:
SI = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
Given:
Principal (P) = Rs. 900
Interest (SI) = Rs. 81
Rate (R) = 4.5% per annum
We need to find T. Rearrange the formula to solve for T:
T = (SI * 100) / (P * R)
T = (81 * 100) / (900 * 4.5)
T = (8100) / (4050)
T = 2 years
So, it will take 2 years for the amount to yield Rs. 81 in interest, which corresponds to option a."
